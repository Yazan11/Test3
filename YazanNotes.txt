
-Change the values of some initial parameters:
WOB constant increase = true
WOB = 1
WOB increase per tick = true
-Fix initial parameters naming convention.

-Showing uphole actuator
-Delete downhole actuator defined in the context creator (as the most lower sensor agent is working as an actuator).
-Introduce the concept of "Run Starting Depth" as we are concerned about last sections of the well, i.e. 8 inch and 6.5 inch.
-Set Total Depth (Goal Depth) to 5000 m, and starting Run Depth to 2500 m (attempt all tests on these ranges).
-Get the signal delay as per the current meseured depth.
-Adding context to field agent.
-Change the criteria for // if no agent complained of being too hot, speed the drill up and reduce cooling.
-Field agent now direclty commnuicate with context to increase the speed.
-Remove messageSASpeedDrill() from upperSensorAgent.

-ContextCreator: Checking entry parameters
-ContextCreator/assignDifferentLayers(): introduce 'zones/layers' to handle different formations in same run
-parameters: entry parameters for number of different layers and depth of the variations
-ContextCreator/assignDifferentLayers(): randomize the variations as per the run length
-ContextCreator: Modify getROPFactor function to handle all layers
-ContextCreator/isSoftLayer():Return true if formation is soft for this depth, and false if formation is hard
-ContextCreator/getROPFactor(): Fix RPM equations, by replacing 0.428 with -.428 and 0.75 with -.75
-ContextCreator/getROPFactor(): Rename getROPFactor() to getRPMFactor()
